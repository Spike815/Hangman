# Hangman
My first python solo project from Becode. Here in this repository I created the Hangman game from scratch.
For those who is new to this game, here is some introduction. 
The [Hangman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>) game is a simple game where one or more players try to guess a word, each turn suggesting a letter.

And, have fun ~!
